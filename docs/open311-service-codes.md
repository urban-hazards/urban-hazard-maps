# Open311 Service Code Reference

> Maintained as we discover how Boston's 311 system actually works vs how it appears.

## The Two Code Systems

Boston's Open311 API (`boston2-production.spotmobile.net/open311/v2`) uses two
different formats for service codes. Understanding the difference is critical
because **querying with the wrong format returns zero records**.

### 1. `input.*` codes (app form identifiers)

The `/services.json` endpoint lists 16 services. Four of them use an `input.*`
prefix. These are **submission form identifiers** for the BOS:311 mobile app —
they define what buttons the app presents to users. When a citizen taps one,
the backend reclassifies the ticket into a colon-delimited code before saving.

**These codes tag zero stored records.** Querying `/requests.json` with an
`input.*` code always returns an empty array.

| input.* code | App button label | Group |
|---|---|---|
| `input.Illegal Graffiti` | Illegal Graffiti | Graffiti |
| `input.Litter` | Litter | Litter and Trash |
| `input.Rodent Sighting` | Rodent Sighting | Health Hazards |
| `input.Overflowing Trash Can` | Overflowing Trash Can | Litter and Trash |

**Where they actually route to:**

| App button (input.*) | Stored as (colon-delimited) | CKAN type name | 2024 volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| input.Illegal Graffiti | `Property Management:Graffiti:Graffiti Removal` | Graffiti Removal | 2,501 |
| input.Litter | `Public Works Department:Street Cleaning:Requests for Street Cleaning` (probable) | Requests for Street Cleaning | 22,539 |
| input.Rodent Sighting | `Inspectional Services:Environmental Services:Rodent Activity` | Rodent Activity | 5,015 |
| input.Overflowing Trash Can | Unknown — possibly Empty Litter Basket or Street Cleaning | TBD | TBD |

### 2. Colon-delimited codes (`Subject:Reason:Type`)

The actual storage format. Maps directly to CKAN's `subject`, `reason`, and
`type` columns. These are the codes that return real data from the API.

Examples:
- `Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline:General Request:General Request`
- `Public Works Department:Street Cleaning:Pick up Dead Animal`
- `Inspectional Services:Environmental Services:Rodent Activity`

### 3. UUID codes (rare)

At least one service uses a UUID: `11d12a6d-6ca7-426a-8905-0e1929527419`
(Street Light Other). Origin unknown — possibly from a different intake system.

## /services.json Is Incomplete

The endpoint lists only 16 services, but **CKAN has 200+ distinct type values**
and the API stores records under many more colon-delimited codes than
/services.json advertises. The unlisted codes are fully queryable — they just
aren't discoverable through the standard Open311 service discovery.

To find all valid codes, cross-reference CKAN's distinct `type` values and
construct the colon-delimited code from `subject:reason:type`.

## Service Code Mapping (scraper)

## Open Questions

### Where does "input.Litter" actually route?

The app has a "Litter" button, but there is **no stored type called "Litter"**
in CKAN or the API. The most likely destination is "Requests for Street
Cleaning" (22,539/year) — the catch-all for dirty streets. But we haven't
confirmed the routing. If true, it means app-submitted litter reports are
indistinguishable from all other street cleaning requests without reading the
description text.

"Litter" in 311 jargon almost exclusively refers to **litter baskets** (public
trash cans), not litter on the ground:
- "Empty Litter Basket" = "this city trash can is full, please empty it"
- "Litter Basket Maintenance" = "this trash can is damaged/missing"
- "Request for Litter Basket Installation" = "we need a trash can here"

Ground litter has no dedicated category. It scatters across:
- Requests for Street Cleaning (22,539/year) — main catch-all
- Illegal Dumping (2,997/year) — bulk/deliberate, 96% phone calls
- Ground Maintenance (3,902/year) — parks dept handles these
- Improper Storage of Trash (20,432/year) — residential code violations

### Where does "input.Overflowing Trash Can" route?

Still unconfirmed. Candidates:
- `Empty Litter Basket` (2,560/year) — most likely, same concept
- `Overflowing or Un-kept Dumpster` (95/year) — low volume, Inspectional Services
- `Requests for Street Cleaning` — possible catch-all

### Do input.* tickets carry structured form data?

Rodent Activity tickets from the API contain structured form fields in the
description: `"Rat bites: [No] Rats in the house: [No] Rats outside of
property: [Yes]"`. This structured data is **not written by citizens** — it's
generated by the app's intake form. This means the app IS collecting structured
data through the input.* forms, it's just being serialized into the description
field of the reclassified ticket.

This is important because it means:
1. The reclassification preserves the original form responses
2. We can parse structured fields out of descriptions for any type that uses app forms
3. The presence of structured form data in a ticket tells us it came through the app

### Are ~700 rodent reports trapped in "Other"?

Research on "Other" (General Request) tickets found ~700 mentioning rats/rodents
that were never reclassified. Need to study:
- Do they have the structured form fields? (If yes, the app submitted them as
  rodent reports but routing failed)
- Are they eventually acted on through a different path?
- What patterns distinguish trapped-in-Other from properly-routed?

### Graffiti: Two departments, one problem

Graffiti Removal (Property Management, 2,501/year) and PWD Graffiti (Public
Works, 1,305/year) appear to be the same service split across departments.
Need to study whether they serve different areas, have different response
times, or handle different types of graffiti.
